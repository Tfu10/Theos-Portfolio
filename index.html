    <p style="font-size: 20px;" align="center">Digital media has been one of my favorite classes throughout the year. Since we worked on a lot of different projects, using so many different tools, I feel like I learned a little bit of everything. For me, this class has acted as the gateway to finding out something that I might like to continue doing.</p>
